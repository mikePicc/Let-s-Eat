# Installation
# Dependencies  

To install the depencies of this project you will need to perform npm installation in two separate files.

Open a command terminal in the restaurant_web_app directory. For reference, the immediate directories below should be backend and frontend. And your current path should look something like ...\restaurant_web_app>

From there, perform the following commands:

| 1. cd backend (Your path should now be ...\restaurant_web_app\backend>)

| 2. npm install (npm will now be installing the dependencies as defined in backend\package.json)

Once npm has completed installation, perform the following commands:

| 3. cd ../frontend (Your path should now be ...\restaurant_web_app\frontend>)

| 4. npm install (npm will now be installing the dependencies as defined in frontend\package.json)

Once npm has completed installation, the application is ready to run.

# Running 
To run the application, you will need two terminals to run both the frontend and the backend simultaneously.

Open two command terminals both in the restaurant_web_app directory. For reference, the immediate directories below should be backend and frontend. And both of your current paths should look something like ...\restaurant_web_app>

For terminal A, perform the following commands:

| A1. cd backend (Your path should now be ...\restaurant_web_app\backend>)

| A2. npm start (A script will start to run a node server and connect you to our MongoDB database)

For terminal B, perform the following commands:

| B1. cd ../frontend (Your path should now be ...\restaurant_web_app\frontend>)

| B2. npm start (A script will start to build react ui and open up a tab in your browser to a local port)

Once both terminals have concluded their scripts, the application will be running until the terminals have been closed.
